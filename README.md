# TDD-BDD Final Project

This repository is the final project for the **Introduction to Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** course.  
It demonstrates how to build a REST API service using TDD and BDD techniques, writing tests before the code and defining behavior with feature scenarios.

---

## Overview

This project contains:

- A **Flask REST API** for managing products
- **Unit tests** implemented using Pytest (TDD)
- **Behavior-driven tests** written in Gherkin syntax (BDD) using `behave`
- **Selenium** based UI tests to simulate user behavior
- Docker and setup scripts for development and testing

The primary goal is to practice *test first* development and to ensure proper test coverage through TDD and BDD approaches.:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
